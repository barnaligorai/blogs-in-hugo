This place was owned by Rev. J. Garrett, the first principal of the Central High School in Bangalore, now famous as Central College. This was built in the year of 1878.

### Persoanl touch

  - Visiting this place is a wonderful experience.
  - The vine-covered walls caught my eyes.
  - I liked the amazing paintings.
  - Though it was really a beautiful day, but the entry fee is quite high. So it is for one-time visit only.
