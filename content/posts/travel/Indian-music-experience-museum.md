### Sound Garden

Visit the Sound Garden, there are 10 musical installations for you to explore. You can make your own music on the xylophones, gongs and bells. Don’t miss trying your hand at the singing stone. It looks deceptively simple when the guide does it, but it’s not so easy to make a stone sing!
