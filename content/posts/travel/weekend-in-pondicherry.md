### Approx budget 

We spent nearly INR 3500 per head for a weekend.


### How to reach

We took train from Yesvantpur (YPR) Jn railway station to Pondicherry (PDY). 
Sleeper seat cost INR 265.


### Where to stay

We stayed in Valentine Hostel. It is about 400-500 meters from Pondicherry Railway Station and about 800-900 meters from Pondicherry beach. We paid INR 4000 for a 2-BHK for one night. We were total 9 people, and the rooms were spacious enough for all of us. So per head we spent INR 445 per head.


### How to roam around

Renting two-wheeler is the best way to roam around there. We rented scooters for our trip. Hostel host arranged the Scotties for us. We paid INR 400 per vehicle. Petrol charges were on us.
Alternatively, you can get bicycle for rent or walk around if you are exploring the White Town.
