Coorg, popularly known as the *Scotland of India*, is a quaint hill station snuggled in the lap of nature.

It is one of the most beautiful hill stations of South India. The places to visit in Coorg never fail to mesmerize the traveler's mind, body and soul. 

The foggy hills, verdant forests and tumbling waterfalls create an enchanting aura that keeps pulling you back to Coorg whenever you are in search of serenity. This small district in Karnataka is inhabited by the “Kodavas”, who are known for their hospitality.

My experience was amazing. I loved Coorg and definitely I'd like to visit Coorg again.

Here I'll be writing about my experience.


### When to Visit Coorg?

Coorg weather makes the places to visit in Coorg accessible all through the year. Coorg temperature ranges between 14°C and 32°C making it an ideal year-round destination. If you want to embark on a walk or engage in outdoor activities, October to March is the best time to visit Coorg.

I visited with my friends in the month of December, 2022.


### How to reach

The closest railway station is in Mysore which is 120 km from Coorg. So we took train from SBC and reached Mysore early morning. From Mysore we took bus to Madikeri Town.

It cost me around :
  - Train : 65 INR (General)
  - Bus : 126 INR


### Where we stayed

There are many staying options like resort, hotel, homestay and even hostels.
We stayed in : Holidayincoorg Leisure Homes.
Though 2 persons in each room were allowed, we were 5 in count, still they allowed us and we had a lot of fun satying there. Rooms are clean and spacious.

It cost us around 650 INR per person.


### How to roam around

Renting two-wheeler is the most popular way to roam around there. But none of us were carrying license, so we roamed in bus, auto and cab. The homestay host arranged the auto and cab for us. After the trip, we have realized that the trip was so smooth and husslefree because we didn't have to ride or drive on those roads filled with hairpin loops.

We paid :
  - Bus : 56 INR pp to go to Talacauvery Temple from Madikeri Town (return is also same)
  - Auto : 1600 INR on 1st day for 2 autos to do local sight seeings
  - Jeep : 2500 INR to visit Mandalpatti
  - Cab : 4000 INR for 2ND day sight seeings

Fare depends on the size of the group, as we were 5 in count, we had to take 2 autos and a cab spacious enough for 5 people along with our luggage.
