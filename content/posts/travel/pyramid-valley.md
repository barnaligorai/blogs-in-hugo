### My View :

Sometimes all we need is a break to become more productive. I visited Pyramid Valley from Bangalore to take my break from the hussle of daily life. I spent only in the transportation, there was no entry fee and even the lunch was provided to all the visitors free of cost. I spent there almost 3 hours, and those hours were really healing for the my soul.
