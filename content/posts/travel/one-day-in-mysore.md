Mysore, officially Mysuru, is the second-most populous city of the state of Karnataka after Bangalore. It was the capital of the Wodeyar dynasty, and is considered to be the cultural capital of Karnataka. Mysore is among the cleanest and best planned cities in India.

We chose Mysore for a one-day escape from our daily life in Bengaluru.

#### We decided to visit :
  - Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary
  - Chamundeswari Temple
  - Mysore Palace
  - Brindavan Garden

There are many places of attraction, but we chose only these four for our one-day trip and it was an amazing experience.

### Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary

Ranganathittu is located 3 kilometers from the historic town of Srirangapattana and 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) north of Mysore. It is the largest bird sanctuary in the state on the banks of the Kaveri river.
This place is quiet and still. One can see different species of birds here if visited in season.

The crowning glory of Mysuru, Sri Chamundeshwari Temples is an enchanting place surrounded by natural beauty. In the forest, there are varieties of trees, birds and animals. While going up the hills, a bird’s eye view of Mysuru can be seen and several prominent places be spotted. It offers a spectacular scene when the Palace and its surroundings are illuminated during the Dasara and other occasions.

Some of the places that can be spotted from the hills are the Palace, Lalitha Mahal Palace, which houses the ITDC hotel, Dasara Exhibition grounds, Race Course, Kukkarahalli Lake, St. Philomena’s Church, and Krishnarajasagar at a far off distance.

### Brindavan Gardens

The Brindavan Gardens is a garden located 12 kms from the city of Mysore in the Mandya District of the Indian State of Karnataka. It lies adjoining the Krishnarajasagara Dam which is built across the river Kaveri.

The main attraction of the park is the musical fountain in which bursts of water are synchronised to the music of songs. 

We visited Brindavana Garden at the end of the day and we were running out of time, so we missed the beautiful garden and enjoyed the musical show.
