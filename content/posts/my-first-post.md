Hi. This is **Barnali Gorai**. 
This is my first post on this site.

I have created this site using hugo.
Started with the **Ananke** theme.
Hosted the site on *github*.

Hugo is super easy to start with. Because there is no database, no plugins requiring any permissions.

By default hugo serves on : `http://localhost:1313`


**Create a new site with : `hugo new site site-name`**

To change the site open config.toml and edit settings such as the blog's title, copyright, name, your social network links, etc.


Set a theme, with Hugo, you can either theme your blog yourself or use one of the beautiful, ready-made themes. I chose Ananke because it is simple. Download the theme from GitHub and add it to your siteâ€™s themes directory.
