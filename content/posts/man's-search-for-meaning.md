Throughout the book **"Man’s Search For Meaning"** by *Victor Frankl*, he takes the reader on a journey of what life was like for the average prisoner during the *Holocaust* and adds his own existential analysis.

Frankl found himself in one of the most horrific experiences in human history. Though, this didn’t keep him from writing a memoir about his experiences and developing a new kind of therapy called *Logotherapy*.


In September of 1942, a young psychiatrist found himself standing in line just outside of a Nazi concentration camp. Prisoners, who at first thought they were entering a temporary holding camp, quickly realized the hopelessness of their situation. Their personal items were taken, their heads shaved, their arms tattooed with a serial number, and suddenly everything about their previous life became irrelevant and seemingly lost. The young psychiatrist, despite his condition of hopelessness and misery, managed to find meaning in the suffering. 

> "But there was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer."


According to Frankl, man can find meaning in his work, in his love for another, and in the courage required to endure suffering. Viktor Frankl passed through the darkest depths of human’s capacity for evil, and yet he didn’t emerge angry, resentful, or nihilistic, but rather encouraged, optimistic, and hopeful by what he described as man’s ultimate freedom and responsibility in life to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances.

> "Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way."


We should not ask, "What is the meaning of Life?" It is Life that poses the problem and asks the question of us. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.

> "Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible."


If life is suffering, Frankl’s Logotherapy and analysis of meaning is the antidote we all need.
