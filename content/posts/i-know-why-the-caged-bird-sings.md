I've read the book titled **"I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings"** by *Maya Angelou*. There are seven volumes of her autobiography, this one is describing the early years of her life. One of my favourite teachers, *Thilaka ma'am* suggested me to read this book.


Maya Angelou was a civil rights activist, poet and award-winning author. This book "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" deals with weighty issues like rape, identity, and racism. When it came out in 1969, it was one of the first books to honestly depict the experiences of a black woman growing up in South-America.


Angelou said,
> " I've learned that people will forget what you said,  people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel ".


Though this is an autobiography, this is written in an interesting style. It's like a fictional literature. There are thirty-six chapters, each describing different incidents of life happened with Maya, the younger version of Angelou and the book's central character. She is a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America. Her brother Bailey and she brought up by their grandmother after being abandoned by their parents when they were three years old. There are several other characters who are equally important such as their mother, father, Mrs. Flowers and some others.


> “If growing up is painful for the Southern Black girl, being aware of her displacement is the rust on the razor that threatens the throat. It is an unnecessary insult.” 


They faced many problems due to being black such as the white dentist refused to give her medical treatment for her rotten tooth because he only treated  people who're white. A turning point occurred in the story when their father came to the town and took them back to their mother in St. Louis. Eight-year-old Maya was abused , threatened and raped by her mother's boyfriend, Mr. Freeman. Though he was punished for such offensive misdid, Maya was in shock and refused to talk to others except her brother. That's how the bird was caged (title). 


> “There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.”


Angelou's description of being raped as an eight-year-old child overwhelms the book, although it is presented briefly in the text. Rest of the book contains different plots like how she came out of the trauma and what she did in life after that. At the end Maya freed herself from the cage, fought against racism, found her identity and became financially independent by her own and gave birth to a child at the age of seventeen.


> “Pursue the things you love doing, and then do them so well that people can’t take their eyes off you.” 


Segregation, Jim Crow, the Great Depression, the Great Migration, and World War II are some of the overarching historical and political allusions in the book.


> “Hoping for the best, prepared for the worst, and unsurprised by anything in between.”


The grammar used in the book is old, but one can easily understand that. Description for every character is very visualistic such as :

> "Mrs. Bertha Flowers was the aristocrat of Black Stamps. She had the grace of control to appear warm in the coldest weather, and on the Arkansas summer days it seemed she had a private breeze which swirled around, cooling her. She was thin without the taut look of wiry people, and her printed voile dresses and flowered hats were as right for her as denim overalls for a farmer. Her skin was a rich black that would have peeled like a plum if snagged, but then no one would have thought of getting close enough to Mrs. Flowers to ruffle her dress, let alone snag her skin. She didn’t encourage familiarity. She wore gloves too.I don’t think I ever saw Mrs. Flowers laugh, but she smiled often. A slow widening of her thin black lips to show even, small white teeth, then the slow effortless closing."


Every chapter, every plot, every character is described so well that one can graphically visualise it easily. But some chapters contain adult contents. I won't refer this book to any child for its graphic depiction of childhood rape, racism and sexuality.


Overall it's *a nice book as at the end we can learn how to be free from the cage, how to fight, how to sing, how to write*.

This book is easily available in different online sites. One can also buy it from Flipkart or Amazon.


Thank you.
